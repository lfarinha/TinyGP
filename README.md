TinyGP
======


Full credits to http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/rpoli/TinyGP/ Riccardo Poli which created the algorithm.

In this project I was able to modify some of the configurations of TinyGP in order to work according to the specifications of the Software Engineering course. Besides, I added am User Interface using Java Swing in order to make input easier.
